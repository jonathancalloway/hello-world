# hello-world
A Repository for me to get things started in GitHub.
I hate to admit to people that I do not know anything about git, but that is the case.
I am grateful that there are easy tutorials to go through to learn.  Here's what I would like to do:
-Clone some repos of other container based projects 
-Use Snyk to scan those containers and fix problems / create problems to fix
-Add VSCode to the mix.
